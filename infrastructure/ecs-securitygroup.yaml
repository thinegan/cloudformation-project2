    Description: "Server Environment name."
    ConstraintDescription: "Choose an Environment from the drop down"
    Type: "String"
    AllowedValues: 
      - "dev"
      - "staging"
      - "prod"

  PMVPC:
    Description: "VPC to launch instances into"
    Type: "AWS::EC2::VPC::Id"

  PMNACL:
    Description: "Network ACL Id"
